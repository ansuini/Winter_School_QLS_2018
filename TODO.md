Todo list for the Winter School in Quantitative Systems Biology
===============================================================

Here is a list of things that still need to be done to complete the tutorials for the school


[ ] add installation instruction
[ ] add a test function to check installation
[ ] add a set of rules : How to ask for help if something does not work or something is unclear
[ ] add lecture 2 on regularization
[ ] add explanation to the sections of notebooks following Nielsen's line of reasoning
[ ] add pre-trained models
[ ] exercises

[ ] convnets : add explanations to the notebook, add pre-trained models, endow with the possibility
of switching between training and evaluation, with safe methods for saving models

[ ] extraction + RSM, add references and some figures, to be paralleled from the SLIDES on
Advanced 1

[ ] decoding : add new section on a more complex decoding problem with continuous and categorical parameters too

[ ] transfer learning : improve version now available

[ ] visualizations : keras

[ ] adversarial examples : look for the simples keras implementation


[ ] extra packages 

    -gym 
    -tqdm
    -jupyter themes
