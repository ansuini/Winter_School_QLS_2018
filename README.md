### Basic rules of accessing help

These are a few common sense basic rules to solve problems and asking for help :

- if it doesn't work look into the documentation 
  - man pages (Linux)
  - python documentation (ex. on a Jupyter cell evaluate ?function/module to access help, or ??function/module to access code)
  - from the Internet (online documentation, forums etc.)
  
- if this either doesn't work look for help from colleagues

- if this either doesn't work call one of us

- if this either doesn't work ... (ok this should not happen so often !)

In any case the most important rule is :

- do not get stack more than a few minutes (say 5-10 depending on the problem) in trying to solve things by yourself !

### Team formation

It is warmly suggested to form small teams of 3-4 persons.
We will not assign exercises that require extra work outside the hands-on sessions, 
and nor the teamwork nor the individual work will be evaluated. Anyway it will 
be a more entertaining experience if you work in small teams. Everyone of us has different 
backgrounds, experiences and viewpoints, and we encourage diversity of approaches,
even in a context of very basic exercises like the ones we prepared. Try to 
self-organize teams composed by persons with different cultural experiences,
different gender, country of origin etc. It will be a more rewarding
experience for everyone !


### Installation instructions

The exercises will be presented using Python3 and Jupyter notebooks. 
For convenience, we have prepared a virtual machine running Ubuntu with all the requirements. 

Here are the instructions to make it work on your laptop:
- download and install VirtualBox (https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) 
- download the image (https://www.dropbox.com/s/yo0to00ddwgymk3/WinterSchoolQSB.ova?dl=0)
- import and run it using VirtualBox 

For those of you who already have Python3 and Jupyter on their own laptop we attach a file with all the requirements that can be installed using pip install -r requirements.txt under Python3.
